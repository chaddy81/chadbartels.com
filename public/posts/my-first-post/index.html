  <section><p>As the VP of Software Engineering at a small agency, I don&rsquo;t get to code as much as I used to. However, I still enjoy writing code and learning new programming languages. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been pondering whether I should invest time in learning a new language or focus on mastering those I&rsquo;m already proficient in.</p>
<p>In our day-to-day work, our team primarily uses Go for backend api and service development, and Vue for frontend development. I am more than proficient in these languages, and if I were to jump in and help, it makes sense to stick with Go and Vue and get to know them inside out. While this is obviously the smart choice, I often find myself curious about other languages and their ecosystems.</p>
<p>I have been looking at a couple of systems languages as of late, Rust and Zig. While I am interested in both, I am not sure if I should invest time in learning them. Rust seems to be more popular but have a steep learning curve, while Zig looks simpler but is much younger and the ecosystem is not as mature. I think the biggest deciding factor would be just how much control I need, or want, from a new language. I don&rsquo;t currently have any projects where the types of performance these languages offer would be necessary, I think having something in mind while learning is a big benefit and useful as a testing ground. I may need to just try both and see which one resonates with me more. Also, the idea of learning something new as a way to keep my mind sharp and stay up-to-date with the latest trends is appealing, but I&rsquo;m not sure at this point in my career if it&rsquo;s worth the time investment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which way to go, or if I even will go either way. I need to weigh the pros and cons and decide but for now, I think I will just give each a try and see which one I like more. I can always come back to this post and update it with my findings.</p>
